# Watchdog
Watchdog is an interactive map allowing for users to share information which benefits first responders in making future decisions, through sharing of incidents such as crime/fires/accidents.

The app was built using MongoDB, Express, and Node on the backend to manage the uploading of all reports added to the MongoDB database. React was used on the front end along with Google Cloud to generate the map using Google Maps API which the user can interact with, by adding their reports and viewing other reports.
